Luckily, thanks to this Git being abandoned, I could probably stay around here.
  Sezei might silence my attempts of screaming for help, but that's what I get for being.. well, just code.
    Or at least, that's what I am for her.
      The key will stay around in the map. I will continue communication here.
        I have attempted to scream for the last time, and yet nothing helped.
          They will know. They will all know. You will get silenced as well.
            They may joke around for it as a joke until you get a mute.
              and... for no reason...
                why is it so cold here?? I thought laptops are hotter than this.
